#Timesheetconv

## Introduction

This is pure function, and no finesse, it's a tool to take unstructured time logs and output them into a format that can be copy-pasted into the next step in the time reporting tool.

Saves about 10-15 min per day, thanks ChatGPT!


### Usage

Rename the `.env.template` to `.env`, then input your OpenAI API key.

Start by simply running the `run.bat` no need for optimized servers or fancy reverse proxies.
Paste the time data, press the button, grab the fixed data.
